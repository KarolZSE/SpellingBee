# Welcome to the spelling bee! 🐝
Your goal in this game is to correctly spell words. The browser will speak a 
word to you, and your task is to type the word as quickly as you can.
If you make 3 mistakes, the correct letter will reveal itself and turn red. 
But don't worry—you can still continue playing! To type, simply use your keyboard 
in the browser. There's no need to select anything. When you're ready, 
click the button to start the game. Good luck! 🎉
